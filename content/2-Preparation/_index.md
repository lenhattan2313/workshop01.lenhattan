## IAM User

An **AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)** user is an entity that you create in AWS. The IAM user represents the human user or workload who uses the IAM user to interact with AWS. A user in AWS consists of a name and credentials.

## AWS CLI

The **AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI)** is an open source tool from Amazon Web Services (AWS). You can use it to interact with AWS services using commands in your command line shell.

With minimal configuration, you can use the AWS CLI to commands that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based AWS Management Console.

### Terraform CLI

**Terraform CLI** is a command-line interface tool that enables you to manage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). With Terraform CLI, you can define, provision, and manage infrastructure resources in a human-readable format that can be versioned, reused, and shared across teams.
